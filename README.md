# Daily-Update-Management
My project is a daily update management tool developed using the Python programming language mostly over OOPs and File Handling. It is designed to help 9-member team stay organized and informed about project progress on a daily basis.

The tool is designed to streamline the process of collecting and sharing updates from each team member, allowing for a more efficient and effective workflow. Each team member is able to input their daily progress into the system, including completed tasks, ongoing work, and any roadblocks or challenges they may be facing.

In addition to the discussion panel, the tool includes a variety of other features designed to streamline daily communication and collaboration. This includes Task Assigning, Team Updates, Daily tech and non-tech acheivements and problem discussion panel

Overall, the daily update management tool I have developed using Python is an invaluable asset to my team, allowing for greater transparency, accountability, and collaboration, ultimately resulting in increased productivity and improved project outcomes.
